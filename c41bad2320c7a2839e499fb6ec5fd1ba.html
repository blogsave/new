Everything was super, but in a note to the model, I accidentally came across a hidden sheet. What I saw there surprised me:</span></p><p><span>"I am locked in a warehouse and forced to build these amazing financial models. Financial consultant No. 4»</span></p><p><span>I thought that these Neskuchnye forgot to read the news about the abolition of serfdom, since they lock people up to work. I was about to put on my black cloak to go to the meeting. help. But it turned out that this was not the point of the message.</span></p><p><span>"I can't be saved. Not try. I think I've got Stockholm syndrome here — I already think they're not bad guys, even if they pay their salaries. If you find this hidden list, send it to anyone who wants to work as a financial consultant in " Neskuchny Finance“: here everything is not just like everywhere else. I'll explain why»</span></p><p><span>I broke into the editorial office and now publish the message. Further — the words of financial Consultant #4.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Artistic interpretation of the text from Excel</span></figcaption></figure><h3><span><b>We need to communicate with our clients</b></span></h3><p><span>It's not about social phobia or quantity communication, and in the need to understand the client. You won't believe it, but they often don't know what they want! And we need to build mutual understanding with them, help them understand what they want. Do you want to become just a financial consultant? The hell with it — you'll have to become a second person. psychologist.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>A financial consultant is not a financial consultant unless he is a psychologist</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>I had a client who wanted to increase my revenue by 2 times. We created a financial model and found out that this will lead to losses. It turned out that it did not have enough production capacity to service such a device number of clients. He just wanted to increase revenue, but it turned out that it was necessary to change the business model. <br></span></p><p><span>Or they came to financial consultant # 1 with an idea for a business. We have created a financial model, and we have understood under what scenarios the business will make a profit. They already had some money, but for a full start, they had to much greater. So they wanted investment.<br></span></p><p><span>And the First one immediately realized that it was hopeless. The customers ' eyes burned, and their faith in the quality of the product was contagious. But all this is not important for investors, because there were no well-reasoned and confirmed figures. I barely convinced them first with my savings you can buy half a truckload of goods, test demand with the first batch of the product and pre-orders, and then go to the investors.</span></p><h3><span><b>You will have to take responsibility for your own clients</b></span></h3><p><span>At first, everything is fine: you are a new student, you learn and you know that an experienced friend is always on the lookout. He will help if anything. Only now and then he quietly goes to the side and you yourself lead the clients.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Newcomers are initially led by an experienced financial consultant</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>At this point, financial consultants are responsible for their clients. We understand that the people on the other side of Skype are our partners. We have to lead them, advise them, change their paradigm of thinking in financial terms. Based on the figures collected with your participation, they will make management decisions based on your interpretations of these figures. They can, for example, fire extra employees. Sometimes I can't sleep in the warehouse because of this thought… Well or because it's here coldly.<br></span></p><p><span>Here are some examples of solutions based on numbers. One furniture company has excess inventory in its warehouses. With their sales volume, inventory is kept for an average of 2-3 months. When the owners saw how much of their money was frozen in the reserves, they immediately began to think about how to defrost the extra money from there. It was it was decided to test the hypothesis first, whether customers will agree to wait for the product at a discount so as not to overfill their inventory.</span></p><h3><span><b>You need to learn a lot</b></span></h3><p><span>Everyone here is so progressive. Kaizens, smart books, courses. Self-development, they say, should be engaged in. And not just in Finance. Other abilities must also be upgraded: the ability to communicate with clients, understand them, plan your own time, be a team player, and train newcomers. And this is not a complete list — it is cold and hard to write here.<br></span></p><p><span>For example, I graduated from the University, and after a lot of coursework, I got used to talking nerdy words and phrases. Boring made to explain Finance in simple words, through stories and metaphors. As Einstein said: "If you can't explain it in simple words, then you don't really understand it."</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>I also wanted to please my clients, but they say it's more bad than good. I once had a client want to see all the channels for attracting clients in the financial model, their analysis, and of course introduce management accounting based on the same model. I started doing it, but they told me not to: they said that we would get bogged down in a swamp of unnecessary figures within the framework of this model, and we would lose them the essence and meaning of the model. Accounting is the result of months of work, not just one table. And about the analysis of funnels of sales-in General, a question to marketers, they are in a neighboring warehouse.<br></span></p><p><span>The financial consultant is baptised with difficult situations with clients, here just swings the skill of communication and searching for alternative solutions exits'. Financial Consultant #2 has a whole set of settlement accounts and cash registers for the client. But the saddest thing is that the owner's personal operations also pass through them. Post-factum, it is very difficult to determine which operations are personal and which are corporate. I had to set up accounting "from scratch": create a separate account for personal transactions and a separate document, so that you can understand who still owes whom: the owner of the company or it to him. The poor man then did not sleep for two days.</span></p><h3><span><b>You have to invent something yourself</b></span></h3><p><span>I thought like: in Finance, everything has been invented for a long time, you just need to understand, use and receive a salary. The hell with it. <br></span></p><p><span>At one my client had low sales figures at the Mall. After the end of the month, owners inserted the same low conversion rate and average sales receipt into their financial model, and then saw their net profit for the year fall by almost three times. As a result, the motivation system was reworked, it became clear and simple for everyone managers'. They now see not a dry table with numbers, but 2-3 main indicators, see their scale in the form of a speedometer with progress on the sales plan.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Managers see whether they are doing well or it is time to prepare for a beating from the boss</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Financial consultant # 1 has set up accounting in General transactions in a construction company. It sounds simple, but just so you understand: there are a lot of projects divided into stages, each of which has several contractors (and some of them work with VAT, some without VAT), some of the projects have already spent money, but have not yet been closed. And this is only part of what is taken into account there. The table is out it is a notable one, and several people are leading it, so the human factor in filling out the table is also not canceled. For example, if one of these people wants to insert a line at the top of the list to bring in a new project, most of the formulas will fly. Financial adviser #1's eye twitches when this happens.</span></p><h3><span><b>Not managers, and consultants</b></span></h3><p><span>Clients are not just waiting for signs, conclusions and consultations. They want to learn how to manage their business on the basis of financial accounting, so first of all, we need to change their paradigm of thinking.<br></span></p><p><span>The longer you work with a client, the better they should understand: how much the business earns, where they are located money is frozen, why the business is profitable according to reports, but there is no money at the checkout, what are the key indicators of the business?<br></span></p><p><span>This is why the position is called "financial Advisor" and not "financial Manager".<br></span></p><p><span>I'm fine, by the way. It's just that the keys to the warehouse have fallen through a hole in my pocket. I will go I'll buy ice cream.</span></p><blockquote><span>You should not become a financial consultant if at least one argument has scared you off and you are not ready to work on yourself. This is not for everyone, here you do not just collect signs, throw terrible words like EBITDA left and right. You change clients, teach them to notice the right things and draw conclusions. But you are also your own boss: you plan time, study, and draw up the necessary documents to help the client.</span></blockquote><p><span>Not afraid? Great! The next step is the Academy of financial consultants. Sign up to learn how to lead projects and really help clients, rather than throwing incomprehensible words and phrases at them figures.<br></span></p><p><span>The best students — paid projects and permanent work in "Neskuchny Finance".</span></p><p><span></span><a><b>Become a financial consultant »</b></a><span><br></span></p><div></div>
